# Simple Web Calculator

This project implements a basic web-based calculator capable of performing standard arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator features a clean user interface built with HTML and styled with CSS, with all functionality powered by JavaScript.

## Features

*   **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Add, subtract, multiply, and divide.
*   **Number Input**: Buttons for digits 0-9 and a decimal point.
*   **Clear Functionality**: A 'C' button to reset the calculator.
*   **Display Area**: Shows current input and calculation results.
*   **Responsive Design**: Basic styling included for better readability.

## Files Generated

*   `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure and embedded CSS for the calculator's user interface. It also links to the `script.js` file.
*   `script.js`: Contains the JavaScript logic that handles all calculator functionality, including button clicks, input management, and performing calculations.

## How to Use

To run this calculator in your web browser:

1.  **Download the files**: Ensure you have `index.html` and `script.js` in the same directory.
2.  **Open `index.html`**: Double-click the `index.html` file, or open it with your preferred web browser.
3.  **Interact with the calculator**: Use the digit and operator buttons to perform calculations.
    *   Enter numbers using the digit buttons.
    *   Select an operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
    *   Press `=` to get the result.
    *   Press `C` to clear the display and reset the calculator.
